# College_Assignment_Game_Project
Work done last semester for Final Project.
Group work (3 people) where we develop an RPG-style game using Java.
I was responsible for the design: creation of the character, scenery and items. And I helped with the faster programming.
My teammates focused more on the programming part.
The game is not finished, we are still working on adding more levels and finishing the story.

Teammates: Claudiohsd and jpcuzon
